Introduction
============
I wanted to make a little helper script that I could use to add hashtags and cashtags to crypto related news articles I post onto social media rather than doing by hand as a time saver.
Further development ideas included things like integrating drag and drop for text to post, using PHP curl to download a list of tags from an online source, adding share buttons to share the post directly to popular platforms, RSS feed integration to pull in URL and text to post and share perhaps too?

Installation
============
Install PHP and Apache or equivilant
Clone the git repo files into the web root or directory you want to access this script from with the command git clone https://github.com/SPhillips1337/hashtag.git

Usage
=====
Goto http://localhost/hashtag/ or your website domain and enter text and a URL to convert!
